# Comprehensive Guide to AWS VPC: Clear Step-by-Step Instructions

This guide is intended to provide clear, practical, step-by-step instructions to understand and configure key AWS VPC components, including VPC setup, subnets, route tables, NACLs, NAT Gateways, VPC Peering, and VPC Endpoints.

---

## 1. Create and Configure Your VPC

### Step 1: Create a Custom VPC
- In AWS Console, navigate to **VPC Dashboard** > **Your VPCs** > **Create VPC**.
- Enter a **Name** (e.g., `MyCustomVPC`).
- Define an IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
- Leave IPv6 block as default (unless needed).
- Choose **Default Tenancy**.
- Create the VPC.

---

## 2. Create and Configure Subnets

### Step 2: Create Public Subnet
- Navigate to **Subnets** in VPC Dashboard.
- Click **Create Subnet**.
- Select your **Custom VPC**.
- Define a subnet IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`).
- Assign an availability zone.
- Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address for this subnet to allow internet access.
- Create the subnet.

### Step 3: Create Private Subnet
- Repeat the above steps.
- Use CIDR block like `10.0.2.0/24`.
- Disable auto-assign public IPv4 address to keep subnet private.
- Create the subnet.

## 3. Create Route Tables and Configure Routing

### Step 4: Create a Public Route Table
- Navigate to **Route Tables**.
- Click **Create Route Table**.
- Name it (e.g., `PublicRouteTable`) and associate with your custom VPC.
- Edit Routes:
  - Add route: Destination `0.0.0.0/0`, Target: **Internet Gateway** (create and attach if necessary).
- Associate the **public subnet** created earlier with this route table.

### Step 5: Private Route Table
- Use the main route table for private subnet or create a new one without a route to internet.
- Associate the private subnet with this route table.

---

## 4. Setup Internet Gateway (IGW)

### Step 6: Create and Attach Internet Gateway
- Navigate to **Internet Gateways**.
- Create new IGW (e.g., `MyCustomIGW`).
- Attach this IGW to your **Custom VPC**.
- Attach public route table route to this IGW.

---

## 5. Configure Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

### Step 7: Modify or Create NACLs
- Navigate to **Network ACLs**.
- Create a new NACL for public subnet or use default.
- Edit inbound rules:
  - Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP.
  - Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere (or restrict).
- Edit outbound rules similarly to allow related response traffic.
- Associate NACL with correct subnet.

---

## 6. Setup NAT Gateway for Private Subnet Internet Access

### Step 8: Create NAT Gateway
- Navigate to **NAT Gateways**.
- Create new NAT Gateway in your **public subnet**.
- Allocate or select an Elastic IP.
- Create gateway.

### Step 9: Update Private Route Table
- Edit private route table routes.
- Add route: Destination `0.0.0.0/0`, Target: NAT Gateway ID.
- This enables instances in private subnet to access internet securely outbound.

---

## 7. Assign Security Groups Appropriately

### Step 10: Create Security Groups
- Create one security group for SSH access (allow port 22).
- Create one for web access (allow ports 80 and 443).
- Assign security groups to EC2 instances according to their role.

---

## 8. VPC Peering Configuration Between Two VPCs

### Step 11: Create VPC Peering Connection
- Navigate to **Peering Connections**.
- Create peering connection:
  - Specify requester VPC.
  - Specify accepter VPC (can be different account or region).
  
### Step 12: Accept Peering Connection
- Log into accepter side and accept connection request.

### Step 13: Update Route Tables on Both VPCs
- For each VPCâ€™s route table, add route for peer VPC CIDR to the peering connection.
- Example: In VPC A route table, add route for VPC B CIDR, and vice versa.

---

## 9. Setup VPC Endpoints for Private Service Access

### Step 14: Create VPC Endpoint for AWS Services (e.g., S3)
- Navigate to **Endpoints**.
- Create new endpoint:
  - Select service (e.g., Amazon S3).
  - Choose your VPC.
  - Select associated route tables for subnets.
- AWS automatically creates routes for these endpoints.

### Step 15: Access AWS Services Privately
- From instances in the subnet, access services (e.g., `aws s3 ls`).
- Traffic remains within AWS network without going through the internet.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Plan CIDR blocks to avoid overlapping, especially when peering VPCs.
- Use NAT Gateway instead of NAT Instances for scalability and ease.
- Restrict inbound access using NACLs and security groups; apply principle of least privilege.
- Delete NAT Gateways and release Elastic IPs when not in use to avoid charges.
- Use VPC Endpoints for private, secure access to AWS services without internet exposure.
