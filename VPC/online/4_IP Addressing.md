## 🔍 **Detailed Breakdown of IP Addressing in AWS and Networking**

---

### **1. IP Address Types in AWS**

#### 🔸 **Private IP Address**

* **Used for internal communication** within your VPC.
* **Assigned automatically** from the CIDR block of the subnet when an instance is launched.
* **Visible only inside the AWS network** (or extended networks via VPN/Direct Connect).
> Visible only inside the AWS network (or private network connections).

* **Example:** `10.0.0.34`, `172.31.22.10`, `192.168.1.5`

**Key Uses:**

* Connecting EC2 instances to each other within a VPC.
* Accessing internal databases, caches, etc., without going over the internet.
> - "Accessing internal databases, local storage or temporary storage, etc., without going over the internet."



#### 🔸 **Public IP Address**

* **Automatically assigned** if the subnet has `auto-assign public IP` enabled, or manually attached.
* **Dynamic** — changes when instance is stopped and started unless it’s an Elastic IP.
* **Example:** `18.191.187.21` (globally routable)
> - Example: 18.191.187.21 (accessible from the internet).

**Key Uses:**

* Needed when:

  * An EC2 instance needs to be accessed from the internet.
  * You are hosting a public-facing service (e.g., web server).

#### 🔸 **Elastic IP Address (EIP)**

* A **static public IP address** that you reserve in your AWS account.
* Can be **attached to and detached** from EC2 instances as needed.
* You are **charged** for it when it’s **not associated** with a running instance.

**Use Case:**

* Applications requiring **consistent** IP address (e.g., DNS entries, firewall rules, external APIs).

### **2. CIDR Blocks and Private IP Ranges**

A **CIDR block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** defines the IP address range of your VPC/subnet.

**Private IP ranges defined by RFC 1918:**

| Range                           | CIDR Notation    | Number of IPs  | Common Usage                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`     | `10.0.0.0/8`     | \~16.7 million | Very large private networks       |
| `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`   | `172.16.0.0/12`  | \~1 million    | AWS Default VPC uses this         |
| `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` | `192.168.0.0/16` | \~65,536       | Small/medium home/office networks |

✅ **Only these ranges are used for private internal networking.**
🌐 Any other IPs must be routed over the internet.

### **3. Subnetting & IP Management in AWS VPC**

A **VPC** is essentially your **custom virtual data center** inside AWS.

When you create a VPC:

* You define a **CIDR block** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)
* This can host up to **65,536 IPs** (`256 x 256`)
* You divide this VPC into **subnets** (smaller CIDR blocks)
* Subnets can be **public** (with internet access via IGW) or **private** (no direct internet access)

📝 **Each subnet reserves 5 IPs** (first 4 + last) for AWS internal use.
So in a `/24` subnet (256 total), you get **251 usable IPs**.

---

### **4. IP Address Format – IPv4 (Technical Deep Dive)**

An IPv4 address:

* Consists of **4 octets** = 4 bytes = **32 bits**
* Each octet is a number between **0 and 255**
* Example: `192.168.1.20` translates to:

  ```
  192 → 11000000
  168 → 10101000
  1   → 00000001
  20  → 00010100
  ```

**Total IPv4 address space:**
`2^32 = 4,294,967,296` addresses.

---

### **5. IP Address Allocation in AWS**

#### When you launch an EC2 instance:

* **Private IP** is automatically assigned from the subnet range.
* You may choose to manually assign a specific private IP.
* If the subnet is configured to auto-assign public IPs, it gets one — but it’s **not persistent**.

#### Elastic IPs

* Reserved and managed manually.
* Stays the same across stop/start of instances.
* One EIP per instance (unless using Network Load Balancers or NAT Gateways, which can also use EIPs).

---

### **6. Routing and NAT (Internal vs External Access)**

* **Private Subnet:**

  * Has no internet gateway (IGW) route.
  * Can **initiate** internet access via a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet.
* **Public Subnet:**

  * Has a route to the IGW.
  * Instances can both **send and receive** traffic from the internet (if they have a public IP).

---

### **7. IPv6 (Advanced)**

* AWS also supports **IPv6**: 128-bit addresses (e.g., `2406:da00:ff00::1234`)
* **Much larger address space** (2^128)
* Useful for scale, global addressing, and newer applications.

---

### ✅ **Example Scenario**

You create a VPC with `10.0.0.0/16`.
You divide it into:

* `10.0.1.0/24` – public subnet
* `10.0.2.0/24` – private subnet

You launch:

* EC2 in public subnet → gets private IP `10.0.1.10` + public IP `18.223.5.21`
* EC2 in private subnet → gets private IP `10.0.2.15`, **no public IP**

They communicate with each other using **private IPs only**, efficiently and securely within the AWS network.
