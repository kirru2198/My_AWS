### 🧠 Think of it like a **security guard** at a gate:

#### 🟥 **Stateless (like Network ACLs):**

* The guard **doesn’t remember anyone**.
* Every time someone comes or goes, the guard **checks them from scratch**, even if they just passed by a second ago.
* ⚠️ Both directions (in and out) must be **separately approved**.

> Example: If someone enters and then wants to leave, the guard checks them **again** — they don't remember that person just came in.

---

#### 🟩 **Stateful (like Security Groups):**

* The guard **remembers people** who already came in.
* If someone is allowed in, the guard **automatically lets them back out** — no need to check twice.
* Easier to manage.

> Example: If you allow someone in through the front door, the guard knows it's okay for them to leave later — no second check needed.

---

So:

* **Network ACLs are stateless** ➜ always double-checking.
* **Security Groups are stateful** ➜ smarter and more forgiving.
