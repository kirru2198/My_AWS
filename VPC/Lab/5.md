 Problem Statement:
 You work for XYZ Corporation and based on the expansion requirements of your corporation you have been asked to create and set up a distinct Amazon VPC for the production and development team. You are expected to perform the following tasks for the respective VPCs.
 
 Production Network:
 1. Design and build a 4-tier architecture.
 2. Create 5 subnets out of which 4 should be private named app1, app2, dbcache and db and one should be public, named web.
 3. Launch instances in all subnets and name them as per the subnet that they have been launched in.
 4. Allow dbcache instance and app1 subnet to send internet requests.
 5. Manage security groups and NACLs.

 Development Network:
 1. Design and build 2-tier architecture with two subnets named web and db and launch instances in both subnets and name them as per the subnet names.
 2. Make sure only the web subnet can send internet requests.
 3. Create peering connection between production network and development network.
 4. Setup connection between db subnets of both production network and development network respectively.

To fulfill XYZ Corporation's infrastructure needs, you will set up two isolated **Amazon VPCs** â€” one for the **Production** environment and one for the **Development** environment. Each will have a custom architecture, controlled internet access, and secure internal communication via **VPC peering**.

## âœ… OBJECTIVE SUMMARY

### **Production Network (4-tier Architecture)**

* VPC with 5 subnets:

  * **4 private**: `app1`, `app2`, `dbcache`, `db`
  * **1 public**: `web`
* Instances launched in each subnet
* Only `dbcache` instance and the **app1 subnet** can access the internet (via NAT)
* Security and NACLs configured

### **Development Network (2-tier Architecture)**

* VPC with 2 subnets:

  * `web` (public), `db` (private)
* Only `web` subnet has internet access
* Peering with Production VPC
* Secure connection between the **db** subnets in both VPCs

---

## ðŸ”§ STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Create VPCs

#### 1.1 Create **Production VPC**

* CIDR block: `10.0.0.0/16`
* Name: `ProductionVPC`

#### 1.2 Create **Development VPC**

* CIDR block: `10.1.0.0/16`
* Name: `DevelopmentVPC`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create Subnets

#### 2.1 Production VPC Subnets

| Subnet Name | Type    | CIDR Block    | Notes               |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| web         | Public  | `10.0.0.0/24` | For external access |
| app1        | Private | `10.0.1.0/24` | NAT access          |
| app2        | Private | `10.0.2.0/24` | Internal only       |
| dbcache     | Private | `10.0.3.0/24` | NAT access          |
| db          | Private | `10.0.4.0/24` | Internal only       |

#### 2.2 Development VPC Subnets

| Subnet Name | Type    | CIDR Block    | Notes               |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| web         | Public  | `10.1.0.0/24` | For external access |
| db          | Private | `10.1.1.0/24` | Internal only       |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Internet & NAT Gateway Setup

#### 3.1 Create and Attach **Internet Gateway** to both VPCs

#### 3.2 Create **Elastic IP** for NAT Gateway (Production only)

#### 3.3 Create **NAT Gateway** in **Production/web** subnet

#### 3.4 Update Route Tables:

* **Production/web**: Route `0.0.0.0/0` â†’ IGW
* **Production/app1** and **dbcache**: Route `0.0.0.0/0` â†’ NAT Gateway
* **Production/app2** and **db**: No internet access
* **Development/web**: Route `0.0.0.0/0` â†’ IGW
* **Development/db**: No internet access

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Launch EC2 Instances in Each Subnet

#### 4.1 Production EC2 Instances

| Subnet  | Instance Name    |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| web     | web-instance     |
| app1    | app1-instance    |
| app2    | app2-instance    |
| dbcache | dbcache-instance |
| db      | db-instance      |

#### 4.2 Development EC2 Instances

| Subnet | Instance Name |
| ------ | ------------- |
| web    | web-instance  |
| db     | db-instance   |

> Use Amazon Linux or Ubuntu with appropriate key pair and AMI.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Configure Security Groups

#### 5.1 Create **Security Groups** per layer (e.g., web, app, db, dbcache)

* **Web SG**: Allow SSH from your IP, HTTP from internet
* **App SG**: Allow traffic from Web SG only
* **DBCache SG**: Allow traffic from App SG
* **DB SG**: Allow traffic only from DBCache SG
* **Development Web SG**: Same as Production Web
* **Development DB SG**: Allow traffic only from Development Web SG and Production DB SG (for cross-access)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Configure **Network ACLs (NACLs)**

* **Web subnet NACL**: Allow inbound 80, 443, 22 from 0.0.0.0/0
* **App/DB NACLs**: Restrict access to only internal VPC CIDR ranges (`10.0.0.0/16` or `10.1.0.0/16`)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Create VPC Peering Connection

#### 7.1 Create Peering

* From `ProductionVPC` â†’ to `DevelopmentVPC`
* Accept from Development side

#### 7.2 Update Route Tables

* Add routes in both VPCs for:

  * `10.0.0.0/16` â†” `10.1.0.0/16`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Enable Cross-VPC **DB-to-DB** Communication

#### 8.1 Add Security Group Rule

* **Development DB SG**: Allow inbound MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc. from Production DB SG
* **Production DB SG**: Allow inbound from Development DB SG

#### 8.2 Test Connection

* Use telnet or `nc` from Production DB instance to Development DB IP on relevant port (e.g., 3306)

---

### âœ… Final Architecture Summary

#### Production VPC:

* 4-Tier isolated structure: Web â†’ App â†’ DBCache â†’ DB
* NAT for selective subnets (app1 & dbcache)

#### Development VPC:

* Simple Web & DB
* Internet access only for Web

#### Connectivity:

* Peered networks
* Restricted DB communication across VPCs
