 ProblemStatement:
 Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources.They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company.
 
 TasksToBePerformed:
 1. Create 2 VPCs in the North Virginia region named MYVPC1 and MYVPC2
 2. Create one VPC in the Oregon region named VPCOregon1
 3. Create apeering connection between MYVPC1 and MYVPC2
 4. Create apeering connection between MYVPC2 and VPCOregon1

Here's a **step-by-step solution** to set up multiple **VPCs** in AWS across **regions** with **VPC peering** configured as required:

---

## ‚úÖ **Objective Overview**

### Regions and VPCs:

* **North Virginia (us-east-1)**:

  * `MYVPC1` ‚Äì e.g., CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
  * `MYVPC2` ‚Äì e.g., CIDR: `10.1.0.0/16`
* **Oregon (us-west-2)**:

  * `VPCOregon1` ‚Äì e.g., CIDR: `10.2.0.0/16`

### VPC Peering Connections:

* Between **MYVPC1** and **MYVPC2** (Same Region)
* Between **MYVPC2** and **VPCOregon1** (Inter-Region)

---

## üîß **Step-by-Step Guide**

---

### üîπ **Step 1: Create VPCs**

#### 1.1 Create `MYVPC1` in **us-east-1 (North Virginia)**

* Go to **VPC Dashboard** ‚Üí **Create VPC**
* Name: `MYVPC1`
* IPv4 CIDR block: `10.0.0.0/16`
* Select Region: `us-east-1`
* Create

#### 1.2 Create `MYVPC2` in **us-east-1**

* Name: `MYVPC2`
* IPv4 CIDR block: `10.1.0.0/16`
* Region: `us-east-1`
* Create

#### 1.3 Create `VPCOregon1` in **us-west-2 (Oregon)**

* Switch to **Oregon Region** from the top-right menu
* Name: `VPCOregon1`
* IPv4 CIDR block: `10.2.0.0/16`
* Create

---

### üîπ **Step 2: Create Peering Connection Between MYVPC1 and MYVPC2 (Same Region)**

#### 2.1 Initiate Peering

* Region: `us-east-1`
* Go to **Peering Connections** ‚Üí **Create Peering Connection**
* Name: `Peering-MYVPC1-MYVPC2`
* Requester VPC: `MYVPC1`
* Accepter VPC: `MYVPC2` (in the same account and region)
* Create

#### 2.2 Accept Peering Request

* In `us-east-1`, go to **Peering Connections**
* Select the request ‚Üí Click **Actions ‚Üí Accept Request**

#### 2.3 Update Route Tables

* Go to **Route Tables** for both VPCs:

  * For `MYVPC1`: Add route to `10.1.0.0/16` ‚Üí Target: Peering Connection
  * For `MYVPC2`: Add route to `10.0.0.0/16` ‚Üí Target: Peering Connection

---

### üîπ **Step 3: Create Peering Connection Between MYVPC2 and VPCOregon1 (Inter-Region)**

#### 3.1 Initiate Peering (from `us-east-1`)

* Go to **Peering Connections** ‚Üí **Create Peering Connection**
* Name: `Peering-MYVPC2-VPCOregon1`
* Requester VPC: `MYVPC2` (`us-east-1`)
* Accepter VPC: `VPCOregon1` (`us-west-2`)

  * Provide **Account ID** and **VPC ID**
* Create

#### 3.2 Accept Peering Request (from `us-west-2`)

* Switch to **Oregon Region**
* Go to **Peering Connections**
* Find the pending request ‚Üí Accept

#### 3.3 Update Route Tables

* In `MYVPC2` route table (us-east-1):

  * Add route to `10.2.0.0/16` ‚Üí Target: Peering Connection
* In `VPCOregon1` route table (us-west-2):

  * Add route to `10.1.0.0/16` ‚Üí Target: Peering Connection

---

### üîê **Step 4: Configure Security**

To allow traffic between VPCs:

* Edit **Security Groups** to allow traffic from the **peer VPC CIDR blocks**
* Example: Allow ICMP/SSH/HTTP from `10.1.0.0/16` in `MYVPC1` to `10.0.0.0/16` in `MYVPC2`, and so on.

---

‚úÖ Now:

* `MYVPC1` ‚Üî `MYVPC2` can communicate within `us-east-1`.
* `MYVPC2` ‚Üî `VPCOregon1` can communicate across regions.
