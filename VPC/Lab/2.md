 ProblemStatement:
 Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources.They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company.
 
 TasksToBePerformed:
 1. Create 2 VPCs in the North Virginia region named MYVPC1 and MYVPC2
 2. Create one VPC in the Oregon region named VPCOregon1
 3. Create apeering connection between MYVPC1 and MYVPC2
 4. Create apeering connection between MYVPC2 and VPCOregon1

Here is a **step-by-step guide** to creating **multi-region and same-region VPC peering connections** in AWS, based on your requirements:

---

## ‚úÖ **Objective Recap:**

* Create **2 VPCs** in **North Virginia (us-east-1)**:

  * `MYVPC1`
  * `MYVPC2`
* Create **1 VPC** in **Oregon (us-west-2)**:

  * `VPCOregon1`
* Create VPC Peering:

  * Between **MYVPC1 and MYVPC2**
  * Between **MYVPC2 and VPCOregon1**

---

## üîß **Step-by-Step Solution**

---

### üîπ **Step 1: Create VPCs**

#### 1.1 Create `MYVPC1` in North Virginia (us-east-1)

* Go to **VPC Dashboard** ‚Üí **Your VPCs** ‚Üí **Create VPC**
* **Name**: `MYVPC1`
* **CIDR block**: `10.0.0.0/16`
* **Region**: `us-east-1`
* Create

#### 1.2 Create `MYVPC2` in North Virginia (us-east-1)

* **Name**: `MYVPC2`
* **CIDR block**: `10.1.0.0/16`
* **Region**: `us-east-1`
* Create

#### 1.3 Create `VPCOregon1` in Oregon (us-west-2)

* Switch to region: `us-west-2`
* **Name**: `VPCOregon1`
* **CIDR block**: `10.2.0.0/16`
* Create

---

### üîπ **Step 2: Create VPC Peering Between `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2` (Same Region)**

#### 2.1 Initiate Peering Request

* Region: `us-east-1`
* Go to **VPC Dashboard** ‚Üí **Peering Connections** ‚Üí **Create Peering Connection**

  * **Name**: `Peering-MYVPC1-MYVPC2`
  * **Requester VPC**: `MYVPC1`
  * **Accepter VPC**: `MYVPC2`
* Click **Create Peering Connection**

#### 2.2 Accept Peering Request

* On the same screen, find the newly created connection
* Select it ‚Üí Click **Actions ‚Üí Accept Request**

#### 2.3 Update Route Tables

* In both `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2` route tables:

  * Add a route to the peer CIDR block using **Peering Connection** as the target

    * `MYVPC1` adds route to `10.1.0.0/16`
    * `MYVPC2` adds route to `10.0.0.0/16`

---

### üîπ **Step 3: Create VPC Peering Between `MYVPC2` and `VPCOregon1` (Inter-Region)**

#### 3.1 Initiate Peering Request (from `us-east-1`)

* In **North Virginia**, go to **VPC ‚Üí Peering Connections ‚Üí Create Peering**

  * **Name**: `Peering-MYVPC2-VPCOregon1`
  * **Requester VPC**: `MYVPC2` (`us-east-1`)
  * **Accepter VPC**: `VPCOregon1` (`us-west-2`)
* Provide:

  * VPC ID of `VPCOregon1`
  * Region: `us-west-2`

#### 3.2 Accept Peering Request (in `us-west-2`)

* Switch to **Oregon**
* Go to VPC ‚Üí Peering Connections
* Find the pending request, **accept it**

#### 3.3 Update Route Tables

* In `MYVPC2` (us-east-1), add route to `10.2.0.0/16` via peering connection
* In `VPCOregon1` (us-west-2), add route to `10.1.0.0/16` via peering connection

---

### üîê **Step 4: Security Groups and NACLs**

To allow communication between the VPCs:

* Modify **security groups** to allow traffic from the peer VPC CIDR ranges.
* Ensure **NACLs** allow bidirectional traffic (if used).
