Problem Statement:
Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources. They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company.
 
 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Create a VPC endpoint for a S3 bucket of your choice for secure access to the files.

---

To fulfill the requirement of **secure access to an S3 bucket from within your VPC**, you can create a **VPC endpoint (Gateway type)** for Amazon S3. This allows instances in the VPC to access the S3 bucket **without traversing the internet**, increasing both **security** and **performance**.

---

## ‚úÖ Objective:

* Create a **VPC Endpoint (Gateway)** for **Amazon S3**.
* Ensure EC2 instances can access an S3 bucket **privately** (without using NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway).

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Implementation:

---

### üîπ **Step 1: Prerequisites**

Ensure you have:

* An existing **VPC** with at least one **subnet**.
* A working **S3 bucket** (e.g., named `my-secure-bucket`).
* At least one **EC2 instance** in the VPC.

---

### üîπ **Step 2: Create the VPC Endpoint for S3**

1. Go to **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.

2. In the left menu, click **‚ÄúEndpoints‚Äù** ‚Üí **‚ÄúCreate Endpoint‚Äù**

3. Fill in the following:

   * **Service category**: AWS services
   * **Service Name**: Search and select the service for `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3`

     * Example: `com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3`
   * **VPC**: Select your VPC (e.g., `MyCompanyVPC`)
   * **Endpoint type**: **Gateway**
   * **Route Tables**: Select the route table(s) associated with the subnet(s) that need S3 access
   * **Policy**: Choose one:

     * **Full Access** (default, allows all S3 access)
     * OR, **Custom** (restrict to specific bucket like `my-secure-bucket`)

4. Click **Create Endpoint**

---

### üîπ **Step 3: Update the S3 Bucket Policy (Optional But Recommended)**

If you want the S3 bucket to be **accessible only via the VPC Endpoint**, add this policy to the bucket:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AccessViaVPCEOnly",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:SourceVpce": "vpce-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> Replace `vpce-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual VPC Endpoint ID.

---

### üîπ **Step 4: Test Access from EC2**

1. SSH into your EC2 instance inside the VPC.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://my-secure-bucket
   ```

   * This should work **without internet connectivity**, as the VPC Endpoint routes traffic privately.

---

### ‚úÖ Results

* The EC2 instance can access the S3 bucket **securely** using the VPC Endpoint.
* The traffic does **not go through the public internet**.
* You have full control via bucket policies and endpoint policies.
