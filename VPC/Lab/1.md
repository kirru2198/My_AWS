 Problem Statement:
 Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources. They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company.
 
 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Create a VPC with 120.0.0.0/16 CIDR block.
 2. Create 1 public subnet 2 private subnets and make sure you connect a
 NAT gateway for internet connectivity to a private subnet.

To set up a secure and functional environment as per your organization's requirements, you'll use AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Here's a step-by-step solution to:

* Create a **VPC** with the `120.0.0.0/16` CIDR block.
* Create **1 public subnet** and **2 private subnets**.
* Connect a **NAT Gateway** to allow private subnets to access the internet securely.

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation in AWS:**

---

### **Step 1: Create the VPC**

* **Service**: Go to **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS Console.
* **Action**:

  * Click on **"Create VPC"**.
  * Choose **"VPC only"**.
  * **Name**: `MyCompanyVPC`
  * **IPv4 CIDR block**: `120.0.0.0/16`
  * Keep the rest default and click **Create VPC**.

---

### **Step 2: Create Subnets**

#### 1. **Public Subnet**

* **CIDR Block**: `120.0.1.0/24`
* **Availability Zone**: Choose one (e.g., `us-east-1a`)
* **Name**: `PublicSubnet-1`
* Associate with `MyCompanyVPC`.

#### 2. **Private Subnet 1**

* **CIDR Block**: `120.0.2.0/24`
* **Availability Zone**: `us-east-1a`
* **Name**: `PrivateSubnet-1`

#### 3. **Private Subnet 2**

* **CIDR Block**: `120.0.3.0/24`
* **Availability Zone**: `us-east-1b`
* **Name**: `PrivateSubnet-2`

---

### **Step 3: Create and Attach an Internet Gateway (IGW)**

* **Name**: `MyIGW`
* Go to **Internet Gateways**, click **Create Internet Gateway**.
* Attach the IGW to `MyCompanyVPC`.

---

### **Step 4: Create Route Tables**

#### 1. **Public Route Table**

* **Name**: `PublicRouteTable`
* Create new route table for `MyCompanyVPC`.
* Edit routes:

  * Add route: `0.0.0.0/0` → **Target**: Internet Gateway (`MyIGW`)
* Associate this route table with the **PublicSubnet-1**.

---

### **Step 5: Create an Elastic IP (EIP) for NAT Gateway**

* Go to **Elastic IPs**, allocate a new one.
* This will be used by the NAT Gateway to access the internet.

---

### **Step 6: Create NAT Gateway**

* Go to **NAT Gateways**, click **Create NAT Gateway**.
* **Subnet**: Choose `PublicSubnet-1`
* **Elastic IP**: Select the one you just created
* **Name**: `MyNATGateway`
* Click **Create NAT Gateway**

---

### **Step 7: Create Route Table for Private Subnets**

* **Name**: `PrivateRouteTable`
* Add a new route: `0.0.0.0/0` → **Target**: NAT Gateway (`MyNATGateway`)
* Associate this route table with:

  * `PrivateSubnet-1`
  * `PrivateSubnet-2`

---

### **Step 8: Final Checks**

* Ensure public subnet has auto-assign public IP enabled (Modify subnet settings).
* Verify routing tables are correctly associated with subnets.
* Test by launching:

  * EC2 in PublicSubnet → should have internet access.
  * EC2 in PrivateSubnet → should access the internet **via NAT**, not directly.
