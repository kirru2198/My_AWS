Problem Statement:
Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources. They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company.
 
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create 2 EC2 instances in any public subnet of any VPC and name them Master and Client.
2. Using security groups, make sure that the Client instance can only be accessed (SSH) through the Master instance.

---

To fulfill the requirement of securely connecting to a **Client EC2 instance** *only through* a **Master EC2 instance**, you will implement a **"bastion host" architecture**. This approach ensures secure administrative access using **SSH via Master only**, not directly from the internet.

---

## âœ… **Objective Summary**

* Create **2 EC2 instances**: `Master` and `Client` in a **public subnet**.
* Only `Master` can be accessed via SSH from your local machine.
* `Client` can **only be SSH accessed from the `Master`**, not directly from the internet.

## ðŸ”§ **Step-by-Step Implementation**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances in a Public Subnet

#### 1.1 Choose a VPC and Public Subnet

* Use an existing VPC or create a new one with a public subnet and Internet Gateway attached.
* Ensure public subnet has `Auto-assign Public IP` enabled.

#### 1.2 Launch `Master` EC2

* **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu
* **Instance Name**: `Master`
* **Subnet**: Public Subnet
* **Public IP**: Enable
* **Security Group**: `SG-Master`

  * Allow:

    * SSH (`port 22`) from **your IP** (e.g., `203.0.113.0/32`)

#### 1.3 Launch `Client` EC2

* **AMI**: Same as Master
* **Instance Name**: `Client`
* **Subnet**: Same Public Subnet
* **Public IP**: Enable (for test/demo purposes only; will block SSH access later)
* **Security Group**: `SG-Client`

  * Allow:

    * SSH (`port 22`) only from **`SG-Master`**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Configure Security Groups

#### SG-Master (attached to Master)

* **Inbound Rules**:

  * SSH from your public IP (e.g., `203.0.113.0/32`)

#### SG-Client (attached to Client)

* **Inbound Rules**:

  * SSH (TCP 22) from **`SG-Master`** (security group reference, not IP)

    * In console: type `Security Group ID` of `SG-Master`

This ensures that only machines in the `SG-Master` group (i.e., the `Master` instance) can SSH into the `Client`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Test Connectivity

1. **SSH into Master** from your local machine:

   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Master-Public-IP>
   ```

2. From Master, **SSH into Client** using its **Private IP**:

   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Client-Private-IP>
   ```

> ðŸ”’ Even though Client is in a public subnet, no one can SSH into it directly â€” only Master can, by design of the security group.

---

### ðŸ”¹ (Optional) Step 4: Tighten Security Further

* Remove public IP from Client (in production)
* Place Client in a **private subnet** for better isolation
* Use **Session Manager** or **bastion automation** for long-term secure access
