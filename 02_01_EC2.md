To solve the problem statement for configuring an EC2 instance for XYZ Corporationâ€™s web-based application and customizing the webpage, follow these steps:

## Solution

### Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance in US-East-1 (N. Virginia) Region

1. **Log in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.

2. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:**
   - From the AWS Console, search for **EC2** in the search bar and select the **EC2** service.

3. **Launch an Instance:**
   - Click on **Launch Instance** to create a new EC2 instance.
   - **Select an AMI** (Amazon Machine Image):
     - Choose **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS** or the latest Ubuntu version from the available options.
   
4. **Choose Instance Type:**
   - Select an appropriate instance type based on your requirements. For testing, you can choose the **t2.micro** instance (eligible for the free tier).

5. **Configure Instance:**
   - Choose the defaults for network and subnet. Make sure to select the **US-East-1** (N. Virginia) region for the instance.

6. **Add Storage:**
   - Leave the default storage settings unless you need additional storage.

7. **Configure Security Group:**
   - Create a new security group or select an existing one.
   - Add the following inbound rules:
     - **HTTP (Port 80)**: Allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
     - **SSH (Port 22)**: Allow access from your IP address.

8. **Launch the Instance:**
   - Review the configuration and click **Launch**.
   - When prompted, select or create a new SSH key pair and download it to your computer.

### Step 2: Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH

1. **Obtain Public IP Address:**
   - After the instance is running, find the **Public IPv4 address** of your EC2 instance in the EC2 dashboard.

2. **Connect via SSH:**
   - Open a terminal on your local machine and connect to the EC2 instance using the following command:
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-Address>
     ```
     Replace `/path/to/your-key.pem` with the actual path to your downloaded SSH key and `<Public-IP-Address>` with your EC2 instance's public IP.

   - If prompted to confirm the connection, type **yes**.

### Step 3: Install Nginx on the Instance

1. **Update the Package Index:**
   - Run the following commands to update the package lists for the latest available software:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

2. **Install Nginx:**
   - Install Nginx using the command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nginx -y
     ```

3. **Start Nginx:**
   - Start the Nginx service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     ```

4. **Enable Nginx to Start on Boot:**
   - Enable Nginx to start automatically when the server reboots:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable nginx
     ```

### Step 4: Change the Default Nginx Webpage

1. **Navigate to the Nginx Default HTML Directory:**
   - The default Nginx HTML page is located at `/var/www/html/`. Navigate to this directory:
     ```bash
     cd /var/www/html/
     ```

2. **Create a Custom HTML Page:**
   - Backup the existing `index.html` file:
     ```bash
     sudo mv index.html index.html.bak
     ```

   - Create a new `index.html` file with the "Hello World" message:
     ```bash
     echo "Hello World" | sudo tee index.html
     ```

3. **Set Correct Permissions (if needed):**
   - Ensure that the correct permissions are set for the `index.html` file:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 644 index.html
     ```

### Step 5: Verify the Webpage

1. **Open a Web Browser:**
   - Go to the public IP address of your EC2 instance in a web browser (e.g., `http://<Public-IP-Address>`).

2. **Check the "Hello World" Page:**
   - You should see a page displaying **"Hello World"**.

### Conclusion

You have successfully created an EC2 instance with Ubuntu, installed Nginx, and replaced the default Nginx webpage with a custom page displaying **"Hello World"**.
