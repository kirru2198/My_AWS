 Problem Statement:
 You work for XYZ Corporation. Your company has multiple branch offices all over the country. They want to deploy their application on AWS that reads data from the usersâ€™ devices and sends reports to all the branches. The application also requires executing complex relational joins and updates. They want high availability for their application.
 
 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Build a highly scalable database and make sure that it's always available and accessible. Manage automated backup for this database with retention period of 2 days.
 2. Build a database architecture which lets your application read data from different regions.
 3. Establish a database architecture to process the data collected for near real-time analysis.

As the user base of the application increases, your corporation observed a significant latency in the transfer of data to the branches. Your company realized that most of the time, the same kind of data is being fetched and sent to the branches.
You are asked to:
 1. Find and implement the solution in order to resolve the latency issues
