# CloudFormation SNS

## Problem Statement:
You work for XYZ Corporation. Your team is tasked with deploying similar architectures multiple times for testing, development, and production purposes. Implement CloudFormation for the tasks assigned to you below.

## Tasks to Be Performed:
1. Use the template from **CloudFormation Task 1**.
2. Add a notification to the CloudFormation stack using **SNS** so that you receive an email notification for every step of the stack creation process.

--- 
Great! Let‚Äôs walk through the **step-by-step process** to complete both CloudFormation tasks. This will include writing a CloudFormation YAML template and setting up an SNS topic with email notifications.

## ‚úÖ **CloudFormation Task 1: Create S3 Bucket with Versioning**

### Step 1: Create a CloudFormation YAML Template

Create a file named `s3-bucket.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Create an S3 bucket with versioning enabled

Parameters:
  YourName:
    Type: String
    Description: kiran

Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub "intellipaat-${YourName}"
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled

Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Description: Name of the created S3 bucket
    Value: !Ref MyS3Bucket
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Stack

1. Go to AWS CloudFormation console.
2. Click **Create stack > With new resources (standard)**.
3. Choose **Template is ready**, and upload the `s3-bucket.yml`.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Enter stack name (e.g., `S3BucketStack`) and input your name for the parameter.
6. Click through the rest of the steps and click **Create stack**.

## ‚úÖ **CloudFormation Task 2: Add SNS Notifications for Stack Events**

### Step 1: Modify the Template from Task 1

Create a new file `s3-bucket-with-sns.yml` and update as follows:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Create S3 bucket with versioning and SNS notifications

Parameters:
  YourName:
    Type: String
    Description: kiran
  EmailAddress:
    Type: String
    Description: kirru2198@gmail.com

Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub "intellipaat-${YourName}"
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled

  MySNSTopic:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
    Properties:
      Subscription:
        - Endpoint: !Ref EmailAddress
          Protocol: email

  TopicPolicy:
    Type: AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy
    Properties:
      Topics:
        - !Ref MySNSTopic
      PolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal: "*"
            Action: "sns:Publish"
            Resource: "*"

Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Description: Name of the created S3 bucket
    Value: !Ref MyS3Bucket
  SNSTopicARN:
    Description: ARN of the SNS topic
    Value: !Ref MySNSTopic
```

> üí° This stack sets up the S3 bucket and an SNS topic that emails you when messages are published to it. It won‚Äôt automatically notify for **each stack event**, but this is the CloudFormation-level implementation.

### Step 2: Deploy the Stack

1. Go to AWS CloudFormation.
2. Click **Create stack > With new resources (standard)**.
3. Upload the new `s3-bucket-with-sns.yml`.
4. Enter stack name (e.g., `S3BucketWithSNSNotification`).
5. Enter your name and a valid **email address** for the `EmailAddress` parameter.
6. Click through and **create** the stack.

### Step 3: Confirm the Email Subscription

Check your email inbox and **confirm the subscription** to the SNS topic.

## Optional: Get Notifications for CloudFormation Stack Events (Extra)

To receive actual **stack event** notifications (not just SNS from resources in the stack), you must:

1. Create a **CloudWatch Event Rule** that triggers on CloudFormation events.
2. Use that rule to send notifications via SNS.

Let me know if you'd like that advanced setup too ‚Äî happy to walk you through!

---

Sure! Here's a clear **overview** of both CloudFormation tasks and a summary of the steps happening in the code:

---

## ‚úÖ **CloudFormation Task 1 ‚Äì Overview**
### üéØ Goal:
- Create an S3 bucket named `intellipaat-<yourname>`.
- Enable versioning on that bucket.

### üîß Code Summary:
- **Parameter**: Takes your name as input to generate a custom bucket name.
- **Resource**: Creates an `AWS::S3::Bucket`.
- **Versioning**: Enabled via the `VersioningConfiguration` property.
- **Output**: Displays the bucket name after stack creation.

---

## ‚úÖ **CloudFormation Task 2 ‚Äì Overview**
### üéØ Goal:
- Extend the template from Task 1 to include **SNS notifications** for CloudFormation stack events.

### üîß Code Summary:
- **Uses previous template**: Reuses the S3 bucket creation and versioning logic.
- **Adds SNS Topic**:
  - Creates an `AWS::SNS::Topic`.
  - Subscribes an email address to it.
- **Adds SNS Topic Policy**: Grants permissions for publishing.
- **Notification Setup**: You receive an email to confirm the subscription.
  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note*: This template sets up SNS and subscription but does **not** automatically notify for **every step of the stack creation** (you'd need CloudWatch Events for that). Want to include that next?

---

Let me know if you'd like me to generate the CloudWatch Event Rule to complete **real-time notifications for every stack step**.

---
Great question! Let's go over **how you can check and verify** that everything is working correctly ‚Äî for **both tasks**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Checking CloudFormation Task 1** (S3 bucket creation with versioning):

### ‚úîÔ∏è Option 1: Via AWS Console

1. **Go to S3 Console**:  
   [https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3)
   
2. **Search for your bucket**:  
   Look for a bucket named `Intellipaat-<yourname>`. For example: `Intellipaat-JohnDoe`

3. **Click on the bucket**

4. Go to the **"Properties"** tab

5. Scroll down to **‚ÄúBucket Versioning‚Äù**  
   Make sure it says: ‚úÖ **Enabled**

---

### ‚úîÔ∏è Option 2: Use AWS CLI (optional)

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket Intellipaat-<yourname>
```

You should get something like:

```json
{
  "Status": "Enabled"
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Checking CloudFormation Task 2** (SNS notifications):

### ‚úîÔ∏è Step 1: Confirm you got the **subscription email**
- You should‚Äôve received a **‚ÄúConfirm subscription‚Äù** email from AWS SNS
- If not, go to the **SNS Console** > **Topics** > Select your topic > check "Subscriptions"

---

### ‚úîÔ∏è Step 2: Check SNS Topic and Subscription

1. Go to the **SNS Console**:  
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns)

2. Click on **Topics**, find:  
   `Intellipaat-StackNotification-<yourname>`

3. Click on the topic and go to the **‚ÄúSubscriptions‚Äù** tab

4. Make sure your email is listed and its status is: ‚úÖ **Confirmed**

---

### ‚úîÔ∏è Step 3: Trigger a Stack Update to Test Notifications

To see if notifications work:
1. Go back to **CloudFormation**
2. Select your stack
3. Click **Update**
4. Choose **Replace current template**, upload the same file again (even unchanged)
5. Click through and finish update

‚òëÔ∏è If everything works, you should receive an **email from AWS SNS** about the stack update event.

---

Ah yes ‚Äî that ‚ÄúNo updates are to be performed‚Äù message means that CloudFormation looked at your stack and saw that the template hasn't changed, so it didn‚Äôt do anything.

But no worries ‚Äî there are **a few easy ways to force a change** so that the stack updates and triggers the SNS notification.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Make a Small Change to the Template

Edit your YAML template with a **tiny, harmless change** ‚Äî like adding a tag to the bucket.

### üîß Example: Add a Tag to the S3 Bucket

Modify your `MyS3Bucket` resource like this:

```yaml
MyS3Bucket:
  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
  Properties:
    BucketName: !Sub Intellipaat-${YourName}
    VersioningConfiguration:
      Status: Enabled
    Tags:
      - Key: Updated
        Value: True
```

This change won‚Äôt break anything ‚Äî but it **will force a stack update**.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 2: Add a Dummy Resource

If you don‚Äôt want to touch your S3 config, just add a fake/dummy resource like a **CloudFormation WaitConditionHandle**.

```yaml
DummyHandle:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle
```

This resource won‚Äôt actually do anything, but it will force a change.

---

## ‚úÖ Deploying the Update

Once you‚Äôve made your small change:

1. Go to **CloudFormation > Select your stack**
2. Click **Update**
3. Choose **‚ÄúReplace current template‚Äù** and upload the new version
4. Click through and **Create/update**

---

## ‚úÖ Then Check for Notifications

Once the update starts, you should:

- Receive **one or more emails** from SNS during the stack update process
- See progress in **CloudFormation Events tab**

---

Want me to send you a modified YAML template with this small change added?
