# Publishing Amazon SNS Messages Privately

## Industry: Healthcare

### Problem Statement:
How to secure patient records online and send them privately to the intended party.

### Topics:
In this project, you will be working on a hospital project to send reports online and develop a platform so that patients can access the reports via mobile and push notifications. You will publish the report to Amazon SNS while keeping it secure and private. Your message will be hosted on an EC2 instance within your Amazon VPC. By publishing the messages privately, you can improve the message delivery and receipt through Amazon SNS.

### Highlights:
1. **AWS CloudFormation** to create a VPC.
2. **Connect VPC** with AWS SNS.
3. **Publish message privately** with SNS.

# Solution: Publishing Amazon SNS Messages Privately in Healthcare

## 1. **Create a VPC Using AWS CloudFormation**

The first step is to set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using **AWS CloudFormation**. This will help isolate the infrastructure and secure the communication between services like EC2, SNS, and any other components used in the system.

### Steps to Create a VPC:
1. **Create a CloudFormation Template**:
   - Define a VPC with appropriate subnets (public and private) for EC2 instances and other resources.
   - Specify routing tables, NAT gateways, and security groups for controlled network access.
   - Example CloudFormation YAML template for a basic VPC setup:

   ```yaml
   AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
   Resources:
     MyVPC:
       Type: 'AWS::EC2::VPC'
       Properties:
         CidrBlock: '10.0.0.0/16'
         EnableDnsSupport: 'true'
         EnableDnsHostnames: 'true'

     MySubnetPrivate:
       Type: 'AWS::EC2::Subnet'
       Properties:
         VpcId: !Ref MyVPC
         CidrBlock: '10.0.1.0/24'
         AvailabilityZone: 'us-west-2a'
         MapPublicIpOnLaunch: 'false'

     MySubnetPublic:
       Type: 'AWS::EC2::Subnet'
       Properties:
         VpcId: !Ref MyVPC
         CidrBlock: '10.0.0.0/24'
         AvailabilityZone: 'us-west-2a'
         MapPublicIpOnLaunch: 'true'
         
     MyInternetGateway:
       Type: 'AWS::EC2::InternetGateway'
       Properties: {}
     
     MyVPCGatewayAttachment:
       Type: 'AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment'
       Properties:
         VpcId: !Ref MyVPC
         InternetGatewayId: !Ref MyInternetGateway
   ```

2. **Deploy the CloudFormation Stack**:
   - Upload the YAML template to the AWS CloudFormation console and create a new stack.
   - This will provision the VPC, subnets, and other necessary networking components.

## 2. **Connect VPC with AWS SNS**

After creating the VPC, the next step is to set up **Amazon SNS** within the VPC to ensure secure and private message delivery. You can configure SNS to interact with your private EC2 instances and publish messages securely.

### Steps to Connect VPC with AWS SNS:
1. **Create a Private SNS Topic**:
   - In the **Amazon SNS console**, create a new SNS topic for publishing patient reports.
   - Configure the topic to allow access only from within the VPC or via specific IAM roles and policies.
   
2. **Set Up an EC2 Instance**:
   - Launch an **EC2 instance** in the private subnet of the VPC (ensuring that it's within the secure, isolated network).
   - Configure the EC2 instance with appropriate security groups and IAM roles, ensuring it can publish messages to SNS.

3. **Secure SNS Topic with IAM Policy**:
   - Create an **IAM policy** for the EC2 instance, allowing it to publish messages to the SNS topic securely.
   - Attach this IAM policy to the EC2 instance role.

4. **Ensure Private Communication**:
   - To ensure that SNS messages are sent privately within the VPC, ensure that the EC2 instance's network configuration does not expose any sensitive data to the public internet.

## 3. **Publish Message Privately with SNS**

To securely publish patient reports, the EC2 instance will push messages to the SNS topic in a private manner. By leveraging IAM roles and VPC networking, we ensure that sensitive healthcare data is sent securely.

### Steps to Publish Messages Privately:
1. **Set Up EC2 to Publish to SNS**:
   - On the EC2 instance, install the **AWS SDK** (e.g., for PHP, Python, or Node.js) to interact with SNS.
   - Configure the application to retrieve patient reports and send them as messages to the SNS topic.

   Example using Python and `boto3` (AWS SDK for Python):
   ```python
   import boto3

   # Create SNS client
   sns_client = boto3.client('sns')

   # Define SNS topic ARN
   sns_topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:PatientReportsTopic'

   # Message to send (patient report)
   message = "Patient report: XYZ"

   # Publish the message
   sns_client.publish(
       TopicArn=sns_topic_arn,
       Message=message,
       Subject='Patient Report'
   )
   ```

2. **Ensure Secure Transport**:
   - Use **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to ensure that data is transmitted securely between the EC2 instance and SNS.
   - Ensure that the **security group** of the EC2 instance is configured to allow only necessary communication, i.e., restricting outbound traffic to only SNS and internal services.

3. **Enable Encryption for Sensitive Data**:
   - Enable **SNS message encryption** to ensure that the patient report is encrypted while at rest and in transit.
   - Use **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** to manage encryption keys.

4. **Set Up Notifications for Patients**:
   - You can configure **mobile push notifications** using Amazon SNS to alert patients when their report is available.
   - Create a **platform application** in SNS (e.g., for iOS, Android) and subscribe patient mobile devices to the topic.

## 4. **Testing and Monitoring**

### Steps to Test and Monitor the Solution:
1. **Test SNS Message Publishing**:
   - Ensure that the EC2 instance is successfully publishing messages to the SNS topic and that the messages are delivered to intended recipients (e.g., mobile devices).
   
2. **Monitor the SNS Topic**:
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the SNS topic and track message delivery and receipt. Set up CloudWatch metrics and alarms to detect issues in message delivery.
   
3. **Verify Data Security**:
   - Ensure that all messages are securely published and that only authorized users or services can access the SNS topic. Regularly audit IAM roles and policies to ensure proper access controls.

### Conclusion

By leveraging **AWS CloudFormation**, **SNS**, and **EC2** within a private **VPC**, this solution securely delivers patient reports to intended recipients via push notifications. The use of encryption, secure IAM policies, and private networking ensures that patient data is protected throughout the process.
